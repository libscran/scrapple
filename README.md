# User-friendly wrappers to scrapper

The **scrapple** package provides high-level wrappers around the bindings in the [**scrapper**](https://github.com/libscran/scrapper) package.
The aim is to enable convenient analysis of single-cell data in interactive sessions and user scripts,
through interoperability with Bioconductor data structures like `SingleCellExperiment` and improved formatting of the results.
By comparison, **scrapper** is a no-frills package that is mostly intended for other developers.
