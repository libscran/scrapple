Title: User-Friendly Functions for Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis
Description: 
    Implements user-friendly wrappers to the low-level utilities from the scrapper package.
    The wrapper functions provide interoperability with SummarizedExperiment objects and more convenient formatting of results.
    The goal is to improve the ergonomics of a scRNA-seq analysis in an interactive session or script.    
    In contrast, the scrapper functions are more spartan and intended for other package developers.
