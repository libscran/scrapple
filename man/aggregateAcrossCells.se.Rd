\arguments{
\item{x}{A \link[SummarizedExperiment]{SummarizedExperiment} object or one of its subclasses.
Rows correspond to genes and columns correspond to cells.}

\item{factors, num.threads}{Arguments to pass to \code{\link[scrapper]{aggregateAcrossCells}}.}

\item{more.aggr.args}{Named list of additional arguments to pass to \code{\link[scrapper]{aggregateAcrossCells}}.}

\item{assay.type}{Integer or string specifying the assay of \code{x} to be aggregated.}

\item{output.prefix}{String containing a prefix to add to the names of the \code{link[SummarizedExperiment]{colData}} columns containing the factor combinations.}

\item{counts.name}{String containing the name of the \code{\link[SummarizedExperiment]{colData}} column containing the cell count for each factor combination.
If \code{NULL}, the cell counts are not reported.}

\item{meta.name}{String containing the name of the \code{\link[S4Vectors]{metadata}} entry containing additional outputs like the combination indices.
If \code{NULL}, additional outputs are not reported.}

\item{include.coldata}{Logical scalar indicating whether to add the aggregated \code{colData} from \code{x} to the output.}

\item{more.coldata.args}{Named list of additional arguments to pass to \code{aggregateColData}.
Only relevant if \code{include.coldata=TRUE}.}

\item{altexps}{Unnamed integer or character vector specifyig the indices/names of alternative experiments of \code{x} to aggregate.
The aggregated assay from each alternative experiment is determined by \code{assay.type}.

Alternatively, this may be a named integer or character vector.
Each name specifies an alternative experiment while each value is the index/name of the assay to aggregate from that experiment.

Only relevant if \code{x} is a \link[SingleCellExperiment]{SingleCellExperiment}.}

\item{copy.altexps}{Logical scalar indicating whether to copy the \code{colData} and \code{metadata} of the output SingleCellExperiment into each of its alternative experiments.}

\item{coldata}{\link[S4Vectors]{DataFrame} of column data, containing one row for each cell.}

\item{index}{Integer vector containing the index of the factor combination to which each cell in \code{coldata} was assigned.}

\item{number}{Integer specifying the total number of unique factor combinations.}

\item{only.atomic}{Logical scalar specifying whether to skip non-atomic, non-factor columns.}

\item{placeholder}{Placeholder value to store in the output column when a factor combination does not have a single unique value.}
}
\value{
For \code{aggregateAcrossCells.se}, a SummarizedExperiment is returned where each column corresponds to a factor combination.
Each row corresponds to a gene in \code{x} and the \code{\link[SummarizedExperiment]{rowData}} is taken from \code{x}.
The assays contain the sum of counts (\code{"sums"}) and the number of detected cells (\code{"detected"}) in each combination for each gene.
The \code{colData} contains:
\itemize{
\item The factor combinations, with column names prefixed by \code{output.prefix}.
\item The cell count for each combination, named by \code{counts.name}.
\item Additional \code{colData} from \code{x} if \code{include.coldata=TRUE}.
This is aggregated with \code{aggregateColData} on the combination indices.
}
The metadata contains a list named as \code{meta.name}, containing a \code{index} integer vector of length equal to the number of cells in \code{x}.
Each entry of this vector is an index of the factor combination (i.e., column of the output object) to which the corresponding cell was assigned.

If \code{altexps} is specified, a SingleCellExperiment is returned instead.
The same aggregation for the main experiment is applied to each alternative experiment.
If \code{copy.altexps=TRUE}, the \code{colData} for each alternative experiment will contain a copy of the factor combinations and cell counts,
and the \code{metadata} will contain a copy of the index vector.

For \code{aggregateColData}, a \link[S4Vectors]{DFrame} is returned with number of rows equal to \code{number}.
Each atomic or factor column in \code{coldata} is represented by a column in the output DFrame.
In each column, the \code{j}-th entry is equal to the unique value of all rows in \code{coldata} with \code{index} equal to \code{j},
or \code{placeholder} if there is not exactly one unique value.
If \code{only.atomic=FALSE}, any non-atomic/non-factor columns of \code{coldata} are represented in the output DFrame by a vector of \code{placeholder} values.
If \code{only.atomic=TRUE}, any non-atomic/non-factor columns of \code{coldata} are skipped.
}
\description{
Aggregate expression values across groups of cells for each gene.
}
\details{
\code{factors} is expected to be an ordinary list of categorical variables.
However, it may also be a \link[S4Vectors]{List} or \link[S4Vectors]{DataFrame}, which will be coerced to a corresponding list.
Alternatively, \code{factors} may be an atomic vector or factor representing a single variable, named as \code{"unnamed"} in the output \code{colData}.
